Or you could apply to specific one - and responsive - as make screen narrower - stretches to fill in void

replace all those tables using throughout a1 - replace tds with these divs


Responsive grid system -

/* still kind of misusing float - better way is of using flexbox/flexible box - designed for this purpose - works with divs and allows you to define container div which is parent or container of other divs inside of it - apply flex on parent and then all of children display horizontally 

by default all divs behave ike block elements

you can override display to be flex - by changing display: flex

bootstrap has classes which alread does this
